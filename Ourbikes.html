    <p2> The Trek Slash 9.8 is an Amazing bike, it blew all of our testers away by its capabilities, and how it handled over rough terrain. The bike comes with a OCLV 500 carbon fiber frame. This frame provides excellent shock absorbtion, whilst also being stiff at the same time. The paint job impressed us all. This gorgeous yellow colour really compliments the shape of the bike. The bike is equipped with some top class components. Including a Shimano XT drivetrain and brakes, paired up with a Rockshox ZEB fork and Super Deluxe shock. The suspension on the bike keeps it well planted and easy to plough over rough obstacles. The bike is rolling on 29 inch wheels made of carbon fibre. These are strong and light at the same time. Overall we where extremely impressed by the bikes performance. We where slighly dissapointed by the price point of the bike, as it is almost â‚¬1000 euro more expensive than its competitors. If your in the market for a fancy well performing mountain bike with excellent after sales servicing, this is definitely an option to consider. <br> Written by Benjamin Caullier   </p2>
